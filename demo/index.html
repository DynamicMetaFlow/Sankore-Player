To use this demo, you need to use an HTTP server pointing to the parent directory using the /player/ URL of the server. This is necessary to server the sample UBW files used in these demos. You can hos the ubw files in a separate place from the player itself (for this you need to modify the path to the UBW file in the javascript launching the player).
</p>
<p>
The URL for your demo should be: http://host:port/player/demo/index.html
</p>
<p>
This demo contents two different ways to embed UBW files:
<ul>
<li>Showing an image preview of the first slide and clicking to launch the player in full screen: <a href="clicktoviewfullscreen.html">one file</a> -  <a href="clicktoviewfullscreen_twofiles.html">two files</a></li>
<li><a href="viewembed.html">Showing the player in embedded mode</a></li>
</ul>
